## End-to-End & Acceptance tests support

```java
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment .RANDOM_PORT) // Configures a random port for the deployment
@DirtiesContext // Forces the re-deployment for each E2E Test
Forces the re-deployment for each E2E Test
public class FullyFledgedUITest {

@LocalServerPort
private int port;
